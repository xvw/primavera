# Primavera

> **Primavera is a dependency injection library** for
> [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) inspired by the proposal in the articles
> ["_Basic dependency injection with
> objects_"](https://gr-im.github.io/a/dependency-injection.html). The
> name _Primavera_ is a bitter nod to
> [Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework), which gave
> me grey hairs when I was developing in the JVM world.
